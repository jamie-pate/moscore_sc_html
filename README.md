Prototype scoreboard layout editor.
===

CONTROLS
---
Click on the scoreboard to open the settings.


GOAL
---
Prototype version of html+css based layout engine for hdd matrix display boards.
This html+javascript app demonstrates the ease with which new layouts could be added
by common web developers to Moscore QM. The eventual aim of the project is to embed
chromium embedded framework (CEF) directly into Moscore QM and use it to render the image
that will be sent to the board.

USER editable files:
---
Edit the `layout.js`, `layout.css` and `templates/*` to modify each layout. (editor not yet available)
